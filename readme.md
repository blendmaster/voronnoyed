# Voronnoyed

A simulation of ghostly overlapping gnomes wearing conical hats, as viewed from
above, in webGL. The effect that arises looks similar to Voronoi diagrams, but
don't be fooled. It is actually just a bunch of gnomes.

This is Steven Ruppert's Project 4 for the fall 2012 **CSCI441 Computer
Graphics** class at the Colorado School of Mines.

`voronnoyed` runs in any modern web browser with WebGL support. It was tested on
Firefox 16 and Chrome 22, but Firefox >=4, Chrome >18 or so, and even Opera >=12
will work. No Internet Explorer. If you don't have a very good graphics
card or you're not running regular drivers, WebGL may be disabled even though
the browser supports it. Try googling around to figure out how to force enable it.

Open `index.html` in your chosen browser, or browse to the [hosted version][]
and open a file in the format:
